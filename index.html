<h3>Released:</h3>
<p>06 June 2022</p>
<hr />
<p>Trapped in a dream, unable to awaken,
you find yourself in the body of an animal.
You're a hamster, right?
Or maybe a bird?
Look around!
The world around you is unusual.
</p>
<p>You find that the season has no connection to reality:
it might be summer one moment and winter the next.
Sometimes there's so little gravity
that you'll find yourself floating away,
while other times you may find you can barely leave the ground.
How is your strength?
Are you leaping high into the sky?
</p>
<p>Discover how the universe behaves
and use your abilities to collect all of the crystal shards,
or you may never reawaken!
</p>
